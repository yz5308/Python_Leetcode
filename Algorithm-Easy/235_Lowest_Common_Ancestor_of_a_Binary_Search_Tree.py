        Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the BST.
        According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes
        p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a
        descendant of itself).”
        Given binary search tree:  root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5]

                _______6______
               /              \
            ___2__          ___8__
           /      \        /      \
           0      _4       7       9
                 /  \
                 3   5

        Example:
        Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 4
        Output: 2
        Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 4 is 2, since a node can be a descendant of itself
                     according to the LCA definition.
